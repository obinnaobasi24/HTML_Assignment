<h3> My Biography </h3>
    <p>I live in Zaria, Nigeria—a city that has shaped much of who I am today. Growing up here, I developed a deep sense of curiosity about how things work and how I could contribute to solving everyday challenges. My background in life sciences gave me a strong foundation in critical thinking and problem-solving, but I always felt drawn to the creative possibilities of technology.</p> This curiosity led me to the School of Software Engineering, where I’m currently learning front-end development. I joined this program because I wanted to equip myself with the skills to build user-friendly digital experiences that combine functionality with great design. Learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript has been both challenging and exciting, and I’m motivated to see how I can use these tools to create websites and applications that genuinely make life easier for people.</p>
